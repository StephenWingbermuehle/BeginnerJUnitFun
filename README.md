# BeginnerJUnitFun
This houses a Maven project called playTests - a file I designed to give basic practice for JUnit testing and writing simple Java methods

I built it for my brother's friend who was interested in learning "computer code" so that he could build apps.
After some more discussion and persuasion I was able to convince him to narrow his interests to Java.
This Mavane project is an assortment of basic Java methods with corresponding test cases.
Excuse my naming convention, but the two files you'll want to look at are:
- TestMethodsTest.class 
- TestMethods.class

Good luck. Have fun.
